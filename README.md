# HorizonDB

HorizonDB is a scalable and fault-tolerant database system that can handle structured and semi-structured data, perform complex analytical queries, and ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

## Features

- Columnar storage format for faster compression, scanning, and filtering of data
- Partitioning by primary key for faster retrieval and distribution of data across multiple nodes
- Replication by replication factor for higher availability and fault tolerance in case of node failures
- Indexing by secondary key for faster lookup and joining of data
- SQL support for standard and familiar language to interact with data
- Query parsing, optimization, and execution for efficient processing of queries
- Node and network management for load balancing, fault detection, and recovery
